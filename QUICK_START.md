# 🚀 Quick Start Guide - Financial Q&A Bot

## What You've Built

Congratulations! You now have a sophisticated **Financial Analyst Q&A Bot** that uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer questions about financial documents. This is a production-ready system that solves real business problems.

## 🎯 What It Does

- **Processes Financial Documents**: Handles both PDF 10-K reports and XBRL filings
- **Intelligent Search**: Uses semantic search to find relevant information
- **AI-Powered Answers**: Generates accurate answers using OpenAI GPT models
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Web app (Streamlit) and command-line interface
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for answers

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start (3 Steps)

### 1. Set Up Environment
```bash
# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key-here"

# Or create a .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here" > .env
```

### 2. Run the Demo (No API Key Required)
```bash
python demo.py
```
This shows how the system processes documents and performs semantic search.

### 3. Launch the Web App
```bash
streamlit run src/financial_qa_bot.py
```
Then:
1. Upload a financial document (PDF or XBRL)
2. Process the document
3. Ask questions in natural language!

## 📊 Sample Questions to Try

- "What were the main risks cited in the report?"
- "How much was spent on R&D in the last fiscal year?"
- "What is the company's revenue for the current year?"
- "What are the key financial metrics mentioned?"
- "What is the company's debt structure?"
- "What are the main business segments?"

## 🖥️ Alternative: Command Line Interface

```bash
# Process a document
python src/cli.py --file data/aapl-10k.pdf

# Ask a question
python src/cli.py --question "What were the main risks cited in the report?"

# Interactive mode
python src/cli.py --interactive
```

## 🧪 Test the System

```bash
# Test document processing (no API key needed)
python test_document_processing.py

# Test full system (requires API key)
python test_system.py
```

### ✅ RAG Pipeline
- **Retrieval**: Finds relevant document chunks
- **Generation**: Uses LLM to synthesize answers
- **Source Attribution**: Shows where answers come from
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics

## 🎉 What Makes This Special

1. **Real Business Value**: Solves actual problems financial analysts face
2. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling and configuration
3. **Multiple Formats**: Handles both PDF and XBRL documents
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Modular design for easy extension
5. **User Friendly**: Both web and CLI interfaces

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Try Different Documents**: Upload your own 10-K reports
2. **Customize Questions**: Ask domain-specific financial questions
3. **Extend Functionality**: Add new document types or features
4. **Deploy**: Consider deploying to cloud platforms
5. **Scale**: Process multiple documents simultaneously

## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Better Embeddings**: Change `EMBEDDING_MODEL` in `config.py` for more accurate results
- **Chunk Size**: Adjust `CHUNK_SIZE` based on document type
- **Batch Processing**: Use CLI for processing multiple documents
- **API Optimization**: Use GPT-4 for better answers (change `OPENAI_MODEL`)
